<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;">The American Dream Deferred</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The American Dream in America is supposed to be a reachable goal. but is &nbsp;it reacheable ? Well, not by the book's standards! There are many factors that an Author should consider. The three factors an author should always consider are housing costs, wages, and working conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Authors should consider the wages first as they determine if there is enough money to do certain things such as paying for a PhD or paying for rent. For example: "But as the tourist business slows in the summer heat , I sometimes leave work with only $20 (the gross is higherbut servers share about 15 percent of their tips with the busboys and bartenders ). with wages included, this amounts to about the minimum wage of about $5.15 an hour. The sum in the drawer is piling up but at the present rate of accumulation will be more than $100 short of my rent when the end of the month comes around."<cite>(Ehrenreich 28)</cite>.Unlike in false-reality stories, America is full of very low wages in which if they exist, tips are where the income comes rolling in from for some employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second factor to consider as an Author is the housing costs. The housing costs are what dictates whether or not you get sick from outdoor diseases and what answers the question "Why are there so many homeless people in America? ". For Example: "But as the tourist business slows in the summer heat , I sometimes leave work with only $20 (the gross is higherbut servers share about 15 percent of their tips with the busboys and bartenders ). with wages included, this amounts to about the minimum wage of about $5.15 an hour. The sum in the drawer is piling up but at the present rate of accumulation will be more than $100 short of my rent when the end of the month comes around."<cite>(Ehrenreich 28)</cite>. Unlike false-reality stories, America in real life make you pay a very high price for a place to call home, and, in some cases, you are in a bad environment unless college pays off. </span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The third factor that you should consider is working conditions. The working conditions are what makes a person stay or go to another city or state in America. For example: "Here everyone has at least two drinks-iced tea and milk shake, Michelob and water (with lemon slice in the water, please)-and a huge , promiscuous orgy of breakfast specials, mozz sticks, chicken strips, quesadillas, burgers with cheese and without, sides of hash browns with cheddar, with onions, seasoned fries, plain fries, banana splits. Poor Jesus! Poor Me! Because when I arrive with their first tray of food-after three prior trips just to refill bevs-Princess Di refuses to eat her chicken stripes with her pancake and sausage special since , as she noow reveals , the strips were meant to be an appetizer. Maybe the others would would have accepted her meals, but Di, who is deep into her third Michelob , insists that everything else go back while they work on their starters. Meanwhile, the yuppies are waving me down for more decaf and the black couple looks ready to summon the NAACP. 
   Much of what happens next is lost in the fog of war. Jesus starts going under. The little printer in front of him is spewing out orders faster than he can rip them off, much less produce the meals. A manecing restlessness rises from the tables all of which are full. Even the invincible Ellen is ashen from stress. I take table 24 their reheated main courses, which they immediately reject as  either too cold or fossilized by the microwave. When I return to the kitchen with their trays  (three tray in three trips)Joy cobonfronts me with arms akimbo:'What  <em>is</em> this?' She means the food-the plates of rejected pancakes , hash browns in assorted flavors, toasts , burgers, sausages, eggs. 'Uh, scrambled with cheddar,' I try, 'and that's-" 'No,' she screams in my face, 'is it a tradition, a super-scramble, an  eye-opener?'... I leave. I don't walk out, I just leave...When I moved out of the trailer park, I gave the key to number 46 to Gail and arranged for my deposit to be transferred to her."<cite>(Ehrenreich 49)</cite> in this situation, what happens in America is that in shotty workplaces, the workers end up getting overwhelmed, and some of the workers start leaving the job, and sometimes, even their home, and they start moving to other places, such as Maine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The three factors that an author should consider when writing a book on American life to avoid controversy are wages, working conditions, and housing costs. The takeaway from this very essay is to "until the lion becomes a historian, the hunter always is the hero"</span></p>
