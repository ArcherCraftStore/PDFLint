<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The story of Sula Peace was just as powerful in teaching a lesson as our elders were. &nbsp;However , the book is more than just a lesson. it's an actual story unfolding about typical backstabbing situations. The author uses flashbacks and situations of the characters to portray the fact that you have to assume the majority of people (who don't know you) are against you and actually despise you as doing otherwise let's them take advantage of you and betray you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The author uses flashbacks&nbsp;to portray the fact that the reader should treat the &nbsp;world as if it does not like them and the reader should treat the world that way. &nbsp;For example: "Sula , the girl she had seen for five years at Garfield Primary but never played with , never knew, because her mother said that Sula's mother was sooty "(Morrison 29). This quote shows one thing: Betrayal is imminent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The author also uses situations to portray the fact that the reader should treat the world does not like them. For example on the back cover of Toni Morrison's book Sula: "It endures even after Nel has grown up to be a pillar of the black comunity &nbsp;and Sula has become a pariah". The quote shows that one was betrayed by the other, and that Nel didn't really like Sula for who she really was</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Richard Nixon says: "Always assume that the world hates you, and to work through that." Those words apply to everybody. Including me. Including the students. Including my best friend, Derrick Phillips, from last year. Including, you. Period.</span></p>
