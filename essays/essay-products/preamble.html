<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Preamble is supposed to be the truth about America in terms of the American Dream. The truth is the opposite of the Preamble, however. The Preamble is a far cry from reality as America was once divided in the past, justice has been completely mismanaged, and domestic tranquility was many broken by an act of pure prejudice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Preamble is a far cry from reality as in America there has been one instance in the past and the political where the country was divided. The "Union" is &nbsp;not &nbsp;perfect after the Civil War that shook the nation and killed the president in return. No way. The second incident that happened was recently, was the Ferguson Civil War -- a series of clashes that lasted &nbsp;two weeks after the unjustly killing of Michael Brown occured. The riots became a muncipal civil war, or a series of riots that involve at some point in the turmoil the deployment of the National Guard into that area. what triggered the deployment of troops was the attack of the police command center at a Target department store. The "Union" has no unity at all. Period.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Preamble is a far cry from reality also due to it's lie about domestic tranquility. According to an article from "<em>Newsweek",&nbsp;</em>April 15, 1968 : "Stokely Carmichael spouting [fiery words]. "Go home and get your guns," cried Carmichael. "When the white man comes he is coming to kill you"("The People Make A Naition" 630). These word show one thing: Domestic Tranquility , when a crime is comitted or if a police officer tries to harm or kill another civilian means that domestic tranquility is out of the question. Period.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: 'comic sans ms', sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, &nbsp;there are some words of insight and deep thought to consider. It is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>OUR</strong></span> responsibility to do what everyone as a&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHOLE</strong></span> to do what is right. The Preamble cannot help us. The Constitution cannot help us. Only&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">us</span> can help us. We are Mckinley Technology High School. We are the Class of 2016, and we are the People.</span></p>
